# Bible App Mobile
A cross-platform, mobile Bible application! It can be built 
on iOS or Android using Flutter. This app contains two views:
* Verse Selection: Select the desired Bible verse using on-screen dropdowns. 
In addition, there is an option to select between 7 Bible versions.
* Verse display: The current verse, as well as the previous and next verses, are displayed. 
A 'next' and 'previous' button allows the user to scroll through the verses.
A back-arrow brings the user back to the verse selection.
